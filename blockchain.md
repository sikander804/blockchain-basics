### Introduction:

#### Bitcoin

Bitcoin was the first protocol to use this tech blockhain, its white paper was made by psuedo anaoymous satoshi nakamoto, and outline how bitcoin can make peer to peer transactions in a decentrilized network.this netwok was powered by cyptography, decentrality and allow people to engage in censorship resistant finance in decentrilized manner.

few years later a russian named vitalik Buterin release a white paper for new protocol named Etherium, which use the the same blockchain infrastructure with an additional feature. and in 2015 Vitalik and other co founder realesed the project Etherium where people not only make decentrilized trnsactions but decentrilized agreements, decentrilized orginizations and all other ways to to intract with eachother without centrilized intermediary or centrilized governing force.

Basically their idea was to take this thing and made a decentrilized agreements to it or smart contract we can say. but the smart contracts wasnt the new idea back in 1994 a man anmed Nick Zabo had originally comes up with the idea of smart contracts. so what is smart contract ?

#### Smart Contracts

Smart contract are set of intruction ececuted in a decentralized way with the need for the centralized or third party intermediary.

they do has a little issue , if we want the digital agrements to replace the agreements in our everyday lives , they are probably need data from the the real world, blockchain by themselves cant listen or read data from the real world, this is where known as the oracle problem. these blockchain are deterministic systems and they are deterministic on purpose so everything happens with them happens in their little world, but if there are agreements they need external data from real world and they need external computation, and there is where the ORACLE comes into play.

Any device that intracts with/delivers data to the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts.

however if we want our application to stay truly decentrilized we cannot work with a single oracle.so wee need a decentralized network, similar to decentralized blockchain network. our on-chain logic will be decentralized but our off-chain logic/data and computation will also be decentralized.

combining with this on-chain decentralized logic with off-chain decentralized data and computation gives rise to something called hybrid _smart contracts_.
Most of the protocol we intract it with today are some type of hybrid smart contracts. and there is where the protocol _chaining_ comes into play.

#### Chainlink

it is a modular, _decentralized Oracle network_ that can both bring both external data and external computation to a smart contracts to make sure they are centralized end to end, while giving them the feature richness that we need for our agreements. chaining allowes us to get data to upkeeps and get random number or customized our smart contracts in a meaningful way.

#### Hybrid Smart Contracts

hybrid smart contracts are that have some off-chain components

#### Web 1

The permisionless open sourced web with static content.

#### Web2

The permissioned web, wirh dynamic content where companies run agreement on their servers.

#### Web 3

The permissionless web, with dynamic content.where centralized censorship resistant network runs your agreement and code.

##### smart contracts do trust minimized agreements, or they give unbreakable promises.

Smart contracts are

Immutable
Decentralized
Transparent

### Introduction to GAS:

Blockchain is run by different nodes, with all these different nodes are running this blockchain because they actually get paid for all the transactions that happens on these blockchain. whenever you make a transaction, there is a node or a validator/miners make a small fee. and these validators/miners gets paid based on how much _GAS_ you used.

_GAS is a unit of computational measurement_
**The more complex your transaction is the more GAS you have to pay**

### Keccak256 is an essential component of the Ethereum blockchain, serving as its primary hash function.
